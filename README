== ISP mail admin ==
Web interface for managing users, mailboxes, and domains.

# System requirements (aimed for EC2 t2-micro & t2-nano)

Hardware:
- 1 vCPU
- 512MB RAM (suggested 1GB)
- 20GB Storage

Software bundle for ISP mail system:
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Tested on this version but should work on 20.04 LTS)
- PostgreSQL 12 - Database
- Dovecot - IMAP
- Postfix - SMTP
- Rspam - Email processing system (spam filter)
- Roundcube - Webmail
- ISP mail admin (this repo)

Dev env:
- Elixir: 1.10.4
- Phoenix: 1.5.5

TODO:
- Have user account: âœ“
- Auth with username/password
- 2fa for extra security
- CRUD for domains
- DNS Configuration per domain
  * MX, DKIM, SPF, DMARC, Autoconfig
- CRUD for mailboxes
- CRUD for aliases

Background story?
- A while ago I was following the tutorial on workaround.org (ISPmail on Debian Buster) 
  and got to the point where I needed to manage domains and mailboxes. And of course, I didn't want
  to handwrite SQL query every time I needed a new mailbox, but the options provided like ISPmail 
  Admin and GRSoft Virtual Mail Manager didn't strike me with confidence (and IMO the UI was ugly).
  Plus another free and opensource option won't hurt that much. Right? Right...
  Hence I decided to create Elixir ISP mail admin, not a very creative name I know but accurate nonetheless.

Purpose and goal?
- Elixir plays nicely in this scenario since we need software that will deploy once and run "forever" (khmm erlang).
- In general, my goal is to have a self-hosted, fully functional, performant, stable and reliable e-mail system.
  Besides, the things I just mentioned, I want it to be "cheap" (free with AWS EC2 12 months trial) 
  and low spec (can run on 512MB RAM). I say "cheap" because after that one year you will have to pay ~5$ per month
  wich turns out to be 12*5$=60$ per year and some providedrs offer it at ~20$ which is better (kind of)

- BUT if you don't want to use AWS or third-party solution (this is a self-hosted solution after all), you are gonna need:
  + Old working PC or RaspberyPI (Elixir can work on a Raspberry Pi just compile your releases for Arm)
  + Dynamic DNS solution
  + This or workaround.org/ispmail guide
- If your hardware is powerful enough there are already bundled solutions like iRedMail, Mailcoow, Zimbra, tomav/docker-mailserver (GitHub), etc.
- This is also a learning guide. The more you know the better you grow. Right? Right...

Notes:
* This app uses :os_mon, available to install with sudo apt install erlang-os-mon
* CRUD stands for Create/Read/Update/Delete
