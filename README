== ISP mail admin ==
Web interface for managing users, mailboxes, and domains.

# System requirements

Hardware:
- 1 vCPU
- 512MB RAM (suggested 1GB)
- 20GB Storage

Software bundle for ISP mail system:
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  * Tested on this version but should work also on 20.04 LTS
- PostgreSQL 12
- Roundcube - Webmail
- Dovecot - IMAP
- Postfix - SMTP
- Rspam - Email processing system (spam filter)

Dev env:
- Elixir: 1.10.4
- Phoenix: 1.5.5

Background story?
- A few days ago while following the tutorial on workaround.org (ISPmail on Debian Buster) 
I got to the point where I needed to manage domains and mailboxes. Of course, I didn't want 
to handwrite SQL query every time I needed a new mailbox and the options provided like ISPmail 
Admin and GRSoft Virtual Mail Manager didn't strike me with confidence (plus they were ugly).
Plus another free and opensource option won't hurt that much. Right? Right...
Hence I decided to create ISP mail admin, not a very creative name I know but accurate nonetheless.

Purpose?
- In general, my goal was to have a self-hosted, fully functional, and reliable e-mail system. 
  Elixir plays nicely in this scenario since we need software that will deploy once and run "forever" (khm erlang).

TODO:
- Have user account:
- Auth with username/password
- 2fa for extra security
- CRUD for domains
- DNS Configuration per domain
  * MX, DKIM, SPF, DMARC, Autoconfig
- CRUD for mailboxes
- CRUD for aliases

Notes:
* This app uses :os_mon, available to install with sudo apt install erlang-os-mon
* CRUD stands for Create/Read/Update/Delete
